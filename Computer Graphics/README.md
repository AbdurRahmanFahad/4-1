## Offline 2

In this assignment, we will develop the raster based graphics pipeline used in OpenGL. The pipeline can be thought of as a series of six stages. You will implement roughly 4 stages of the pipeline.


1. Stage 1: modeling transformation
2. Stage 2: view transformation
3. Stage 3: projection transformation
4. Stage 4: clipping & scan conversion using Z-buffer algorithm
