# Ofllines of CSE 410 - Computer Graphics

## Offline 1

### Assignment on OpenGL

There are three tasks in this assignment.
1. Fully Controllable Camera (Problem 1.exe)
2. Gun (Problem 1.exe)
3. Bubbles (Problem 2.exe)

## Offline 2

### Assignment on **Raster Based Graphics Pipeline**

In this assignment, we will develop the raster based graphics pipeline used in OpenGL. The pipeline can be thought of as a series of six stages. We will implement roughly 4 stages of the pipeline.


1. Stage 1: modeling transformation
2. Stage 2: view transformation
3. Stage 3: projection transformation
4. Stage 4: clipping & scan conversion using Z-buffer algorithm

## Offline 3

### Assignment on Ray Tracing

In this assignment, you have to generate realistic images for a few geometric shapes using ray
tracing with appropriate illumination technique.

#### Prerequisites

1. Basic knowledge of OpenGL (What you have learnt in assignment 1 should be sufficient)
2. Fully controllable camera (same as in assignment 1)
3. Bitmap image generation using the bitmap image header file provided for assignment 2
4. Basic idea of illumination, Phong lighting model to be more specific
5. Intersection of line with different 3D objects (e.g. ray-plane intersection, ray-sphere
intersection, ray-triangle intersection etc.)
6. Multi-level reflection using ray tracing
7. Refraction using ray tracing, texture etc. (optional)
