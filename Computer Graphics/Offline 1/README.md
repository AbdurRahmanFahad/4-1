### Part 1 - Fully Controllable Camera (Problem 1.exe)

`Up arrow` - move forward

`Down arrow` - move backward 

`Right arrow` - move right

`Left arrow` - move left

`PgUp` - move up

`PgDn` - move down

`1` - rotate/look left

`2` - rotate/look right

`3` - look up

`4` - look down

##	Problem 2

### Bubbles (Problem 2.exe)

After the program starts, five bubbles will pop up one by one from the left bottom 
region of the square and start moving towards a random direction. None of the 
bubbles will go out of the boundary square. Rather, they will be reflected upon colliding 
with the boundary of the square. Note that, the bubbles that haven’t yet gone inside 
the red circle will cross one another


When a bubble goes completely inside the red circle, it will never go out of the circle. 
Rather, it will reflect upon colliding with the circle. It will also reflect with other bubbles 
that are completely inside the red circle. Note that, the bubble will not reflect with bubbles 
that are outside the red circle even partially.



The program will also support the following functionalities.

`Up arrow` – increase the speed of the bubbles
`Down arrow` – decrease the speed of the bubbles
`p` – resume/pause the movement of the bubbles
